# PlatformerSummer2023

Purpose: Increase competency in design process, game development, and JavaScript.
Although originality started for personal development, I hope to use it to showcase
skills learned outside of a traditional university education environment.

Concept: After a lot of thought, I have decided on a free-for-all keep away sort of game.
Gameplay will be online and in real time using websocket, HTML and CSS elements will
render menus, game graphics, and other website elements. Physics and game logic will 
be programmed out of JS. I want the gameplay to be fast, intense, and just goofy
enough to be engaging and addicting. Priority goes to functionality, later to 
artistic appeal.
